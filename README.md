# Tensorflow-Implementation
Implementing is a machine learning and Deep Learning library made by google.



## Data Source Url : 
```
https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64
```
Another dataset set : Fashion mnist, it is present in the library itself.


In this notebook, tensoflow is used to implement :
- Convolution Neural Network
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Regression
- LSTM ( Long short term memory)

## Software Required (Basic setup)
- IPython environment and Jupyter notebooks
- Python 3
- Conda for package management and virtual environments

If it is not able to install and run these software on the local system
then, online [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) notbook can be used to do the same.

## Language and Libraries 
- Python 3 and above
- pandas => For Exploratory Data Analysis 
- numpy => to work with dimensions (arrays)
- matplotlib => to visualize the data, and look for pattern
- seaborn => to get over all analysis of data using graphs
- scikit-learn => to get different kinds of ML algorithms
- sqlite3 => to ingest data in to the jupyter notebook
